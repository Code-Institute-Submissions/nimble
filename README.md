### User Stories
As a player aged 8+ I want to be able to
1. Easily learn how to play the game straight away with minimal instructions.
2. Get audio and visual feedback when I remove a counter.
3. Be able to play the game easily on a mobile screen.
4. Keep a check of previous wins so see who is the most successful.
5. Be able to play against another player (or the computer?)


### Ideas for development and plans:

[] High Score table to log the wins by a particular player
[] Play against a human
[] Choose a colour theme
[] Audio plays on a mobile but not on a desktop, can be muted on either
[] Play against the computer, with levels of difficulty
[] 'Classic' version, with random number of stacks of counters. You can take as many as you like from any stack
[] Implement tests for those functions which access the DOM
