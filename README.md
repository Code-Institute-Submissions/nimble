### User Stories
As a player aged 8+ I want to be able to
1. Easily learn how to play the game straight away with minimal instructions.
2. Get audio and visual feedback when I remove a counter.
3. Be able to play the game easily on a mobile screen.
4. Keep a check of previous wins so see who is the most successful.
5. Be able to play against another player (or the computer?)


### Ideas for development and plans:


[ ] Change the colour scheme depending on whose turn it is
[ ] High Score table to log the wins by a particular player
[x] Play against a human
[ ] Choose a colour theme
[x] Randomly choose who goes first
[ ] Computer makes comments on the quality of your move - ie was it a good move?
[ ] Audio plays on a mobile but not on a desktop, can be muted on either
[ ] 'Classic' mode, with random number of stacks of counters. You can take as many as you like from any stack
[ ] Implement tests for those functions which access the DOM
[ ] Earn 'badges' for achievements.
[ ] Alter UI to allow playing by clicking on the counters themselves.
